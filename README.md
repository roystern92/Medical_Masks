Landing page so anyone can order masks.

## Reflection

This project was created when the covid-19 start spreading and a new phenomenon appeared: quarantine.
A friend of mine ordered many medical masks and wanted to sell them.
So he asked me to build for him a simple landing page so client can contract him.
I create him a landing page and styled it. I created for an admin panel so he can mange all the incoming ordres and edit them.
This project helped me spand my quarantine time faster.


The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Bootstrap, ReactStrap, React-datepicker, ReactContextMenu, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, ExpressValidator, Helmet, Compression, Bcryptjs, Cors, Multer, Jsonwebtoken. and a significant amount of CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit hole

## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) - The front framework.
* [React-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) - Declarative routing for React.
* [Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) - Predictable state container for JavaScript web apps.
